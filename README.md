# memusage-go

## Overview
This is my first attempt of create a simple program in Go language. In this project I write a code to get amount of memory from a especific user or all users that are logged in your system.

## Requirements
- Go environment
- Windows 7, 8 or 10.


## Learned
- Write and read files.
- How to use `Structs` and `Methods`
- Deal with `command-line` arguments
- Sort data

## To do
- [x] Translate the console info for English (currently in PT-BR).
- [ ] Chage the direct parse from String (used to calculate the memory) and transfer to a struct.
- [ ] To save the results in to a database to do some analytics over the data.
- [ ] Modify the file usage to a `byte stream` to get data.
- [ ] Run on linux distributions.
